Women customers are more likely to buy products compared to men (~65%).  

The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 product buyers.

- The adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%) and buys the most products.

- The maximum number of products customers order from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels.

- More than 90% of the products delivered

## Final Conclusion:

To improve the sales of the Super Store, a strategic marketing plan focused on women aged 30-49 years residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh should be implemented. This demographic represents a key consumer segment, as they often make significant household and lifestyle purchases. The approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions to capture their attention.
